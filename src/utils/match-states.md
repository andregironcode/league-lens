## Auto-Detection Logic

```javascript
const getMatchTiming = () => {
  const timeDiff = matchDate.getTime() - now.getTime();
  const hoursUntilMatch = timeDiff / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  if (hoursUntilMatch > 1) return 'preview';          // > 1 hour before
  if (hoursUntilMatch > 0) return 'imminent';         // < 1 hour before, > 0
  if (isCurrentlyLive) return 'live';                 // Live match
  if (hoursUntilMatch < 0 && hasScore && !hasVideo) return 'fullTime';  // Completed, no video
  if (hoursUntilMatch < 0 && hasVideo) return 'finished';               // Completed with video
  return 'finished';                                  // Default fallback
};
```

## Responsive Behavior

All layouts are fully responsive and adapt to:
- Mobile devices (simplified layouts)
- Tablet screens (balanced information)

The full-time state prioritizes the final score visibility and celebration context across all screen sizes, with a focus on immediate post-match satisfaction.
